## Code linting

In this template, 3 possible linters are proposed:
- flake8 only sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8)
- pylint sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8) and also allows warning about imports order
- black sends warning but can also fix the files for you

You can perfectly use the 3 of them or subset, at your preference. Don't forget to edit `.travis.yml` if you want to deactivate the automatic testing of some linters!
